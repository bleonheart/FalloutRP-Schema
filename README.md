**Advanced Fallout RP**
*A gamemode for Nutscript 1.0 that aims to mimic the [Fallout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)) universe. Usage is heavily advised, as the gamemode is severely outdated.*

## Disclaimer

I acquired Lazarus approximately 1-2 years ago and started working on making my own changes to it, with the goal of creating an immersive yet comical gamemode. Over the past year and a half, I have been actively developing this schema. However, due to significant changes in my life, I have stopped playing GMOD and am now sharing this project.

The base schema credits go to Lazarus' Team, especially Johnny Guitar, but I have also added credits for my own substantial contributions to it.

Some of the core systems, such as markers, were removed intentionally. This was done to avoid forcing players who lack coding knowledge to utilize the entire Fallout: New Vegas map to play, which could be problematic for smaller serious RP communities.

My hope is that this contribution will encourage the creation of more Fallout-themed servers that don't heavily rely on pay-to-win elements just to provide a somewhat comfortable gameplay experience.

Regardless, good luck, fellow vault dwellers! ðŸ˜„
