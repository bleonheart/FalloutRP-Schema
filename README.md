# Advanced Fallout RP
A gamemode for Nutscript 1.0 that aims to mimick the [Fallout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)) universe.
# Disclaimer

I've adquired Lazarus about 1-2 years ago and started working on to make my own changes to it as I wanted to make an immersive, yet funny gamemode. For the past year and half or so, I have been working on this schema, but due to life changes, I stopped playing GMOD therefore, I am sharing this.

The base schema credit goes towards Lazarus' Team, especially Johnny Guitar, but I added credits of my own too as I've added some major stuff to it.

Some of the core systems, like the markers were removed as it'd force players who don't know code to use the whole fallout new vegas map to play, which for smaller seriousRP community isn't good.

I hope this helps bring out more fallout server that don't rely on huge pay to win measures just to get barely confortable gameplay wise.

Anyways, good luck, fellow vault dwellers :D
